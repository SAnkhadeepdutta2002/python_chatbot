# python_chatbot
A Python based Chatbot

This project creates a simple speech assistant GUI using `Tkinter`, allowing the user to ask predefined questions and receive voice responses. It uses `speech_recognition` to capture speech input, `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) to generate audio responses, and `Pygame` to play the audio. The assistant recognizes certain phrases and replies with predefined answers. The GUI includes a microphone button for voice input and a background image, resizing dynamically with the window.

Libraries used:  
- `Tkinter` for the graphical interface
- `PIL` (Pillow) for image handling
- `SpeechRecognition` for capturing speech
- `gTTS` for text-to-speech
- `Pygame` for playing audio
